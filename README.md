Learning Vue.js on LinkedIn Learning by Michael Sullivan

Course Details:
Have you found a primary JavaScript framework or library that suits your needs? If not, you might want to explore Vue.js, which offers a progressive approach to solving front-end problems. Unlike some of the more complex JavaScript frameworks, Vue allows developers to add simple data binding to their views and incrementally progress to a full-blown single-page application, if needed. In this course, Michael Sullivan introduces the Vue framework and explains which problems it aims to solve, how to get started by adding it to a web page, and how to manage basic data binding and control logic. After he covers dynamic content, form control bindings, rendering, and styling logic, Michael dives into the component system in Vue, including the Vue CLI tool. The component system can help you create modular, reusable code that can clean up and simplify your front-end code.
